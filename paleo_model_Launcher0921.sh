#this software is provded as-is and comes with no guarantees
#for assistance please contact the author at willmatt@udel.edu
#
#NOTE: This script must be called from within your 'x_BGC' directory. It has one input,
#a custom name for this set of model runs. Everything else is hard coded by intention.
#
#This is the user-endpoint for parametric runs of x_BGC. The sofware is named 'x_BGC', 
#because the directory, and newly added scriopts are intended as a template
#to be renamed as a unit for each experimental set of runs.
# 
#e.g., modelUpdate02042022_BGC, modelUpdate02042022_BGC_Launcher.sh etc.
#This provides internal source control, as you are forced to update a couple of lines 
#in each code (marked !!!).
#
#
#the general scheme is that input filenames contain information about the runs to be
#performed.
#
#run x_BGC_Lanucher in your experiment directory (i.e., 'x_BGC') for very small runs
#but it is prefered to used a PBS command file (i.e., qLauncher) to run the entire tree 
# of commands that x_BGC_Lanucher will produce on compute notes rather than a login node.
#
#x_BGC_Lanucher will create a Batch directory corresponding to the experiment 'x_BGC'
#to hold files of MET and EPC names to be included in this run,
# and the checksums for job creation.
#
#NOTE: if you've run this with the same batch name before
#you'll need to remove or rename directories created first 
#i.e. rm -r ${BATCHDIR}, where the variables are replaced with actual names
#this is intentionally not automated to prevent accidental data loss
#(see qMv and qRm to use PBS to do this on compute nodes; preferred and faster)
#
#x_BGC_Lanucher is intended to take inputs from upstream software that
#1)creates input files with systematic names (e.g., cesm_to_mtc43.ncl)
#
#x_BGC_Lanucher then runs iniWriter using automatically generated inputs
#

## .mtc43 metfiles must be in a subdirectory of the one containing this file
#NOTE: never include terminal / in any location, hardcoded or input
#set working directory to your 'x_BGC'
export BIN=$(pwd)

#redundant
export BINDIR=${BIN}
#rename binary for version control
export BINARY=bgc
#!!! rename to your 'x_BGC_iniWriter'
export WRITERNAME=${BINDIR}\/x_BGC_iniWriter\.sh

#input location and set derivative dir's (e.g. for different experiments with same model)
#here, a set of MET and EPC files define an experiment
export METD=metdata
export METDIR=${BIN}\/${METD}
export EPCD=epc
export EPCDIR=${BIN}\/${EPCD}
#the one input for this script, a custom name for this set of model runs
